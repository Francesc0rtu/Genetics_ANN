Things yet to be done:

* about crossover:
    the module (where the cut is placed) should be selected in tournament
    "we first select a given module from the two parents (selected by tournament), and then we apply a one-point crossover 
    to the module, without changing any of the remaining modules."

* add softmax (?) like it is in DENSER

* at the moment the mutations at GA level involve only features and classification layers

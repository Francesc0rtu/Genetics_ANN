TODO
-needs to update GRAMMAR for torch!

-the input,output mapping doesn't work beacause there's 
 some costraints on the joint values of differen fields (e.g padding and kernel)

-Evaluator class should have dataloaders as attributes and optimizer and batch size should be given by learning_params and the should be 
 attributes as well
- All the classes in utlis.py doesn't have levels_back attributes because I didn't implementes yet
